# SeiyuuMatch
For when you KNOW you've heard an anime voice actor before, but it's stuck on the tip of your... ear?

After you select a character, SeiyuuMatch cross references that voice actor's other roles with your MyAnimeList account to produce a list of shows you've seen them in.

## Setup
```
npm i
npm --run-script [build|watch]
```
